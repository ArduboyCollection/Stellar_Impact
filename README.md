# Stellar Impact

#What is this?

It's a shmup for the Arduboy game system.

#How do I play?

Download the zip file, unzip it to a folder named 'SHMUP' in your arduino projects directory, then open the .ino file and flash it to your Arduboy.
#WARNING
This game uses a lot of RAM. This means that sometimes the Arduboy can have trouble flashing stuff again in its default mode.
To fix this, hold both the left and up dpad keys while you boot arduboy. Then flash from there.
This is a problem with arduino's flashing system, not my code, so, sorry! 

#This code is a mess!
I know, I'm sorry. It's also completely uncommented. At the minute, this is just a personal beta release, when I'm happy the game is in a finished state, I'll add comments and attempt to clean it up a bit.
