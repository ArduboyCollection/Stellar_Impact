# THIS BRANCH IS UNSTABLE.

Eeprom added, but now resetting doesn't work right. Booting into safe mode then flashing just resets the board, so you have to use the reset button and flash a known-working sketch before you can flash a new build of this. Not sure why.

Don't install unless you know what you're doing. This won't brick your arduboy, but the process of resuscitating it is a pain.

For reference, until this build, you had to flash by booting into safe mode by holding up and left, but now that doesn't work, as stated above.
