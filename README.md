# Stellar Impact

#What is this?

It's a shmup for the Arduboy game system.

#How do I play?

Download the zip file, unzip it to a folder named 'Stellar_Impact' in your arduino projects directory, then open the .ino file and flash it to your Arduboy.
#WARNING
This game uses a lot of RAM. This means that sometimes the Arduboy can have trouble flashing stuff again in its default mode (and even in safe mode!).

To fix this, start the flashing, then press the little reset button with a pin/similar to the left of the micro usb port.
This procedure can take some getting used to, but it won't harm your arduboy. Once you've flashed back to something smaller (for example, the ardubreakout game included in the library) you'll be able to flash normally again.
This is a problem with arduino's flashing system, not my code, so, sorry! 
#As far as I can tell this is now fixed

#This code is a mess!
I know, I'm sorry. It's also completely uncommented. At the minute, this is just a personal beta release, when I'm happy the game is in a finished state, I'll add comments and attempt to clean it up a bit.
